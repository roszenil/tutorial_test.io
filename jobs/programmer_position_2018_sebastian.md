description:
- I invite applications for a programmer (software developer) position to support the development of our software RevBayes in my research group at the GeoBio-Center of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU), München. The position is funded by the DFG Emmy Noether program, and is initially available for 2 years, with a further 3 years of funding available dependent on progress and interests. The position should start on 1 January 2019 or as soon as possible thereafter.

- My group is broadly working on theory and computational methods for Bayesian inference of phylogeny (<a href="http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/hoehna">http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/hoehna</a>). All of our methods are implemented in the open-source program <a href="http://www.RevBayes.com">RevBayes</a>. The successful applicant will be part of our vibrant RevBayes group and will contribute to further development of the program. There will be opportunities for the successful applicant to work with and visit the research groups of my collaborators in Europe and the USA. Furthermore, I expect the candidate to become actively involved in our RevBayes workshops and hackathons.

- Potential tasks of the programmer include&#58;<ul><li>Support of algorithm development within the group (faster and memory efficient).</li><li>Development of distributed algorithms (using MPI).</li><li>GUI development</li><li>Unit testing on TravisCI</li><li>Developing an automatic system for releases on different platforms.</li><li>User support and bug fixes.</li></ul>  

- Applicants should have either a Master’s degree or a PhD, completed or completion imminent, in computer science or a related field. The key skills required are proficiency in C++ programming and good communication skills (oral and written English). The successful applicant needs to work well in an academic environment with 10-20 software developers distributed across the world.

- The position will be compensated according to the standard DFG salary scheme (TVL-E13 to E14 based on prior experience), that is, the position will be based in the German public sector and the actual salary will depend on the candidate’s background. The salary includes benefits such as health care, pension, unemployment insurance and child support (if applicable). The working times are flexible and the position comes with all standard German benefits (30 days paid vacation per year, paid sick leave, etc.). We work at the GeoBio-Center which is located at the Königsplatz and is in walking distance to the historic city center (Marienplatz) and English Garden (city park with 3.75 km² area). The GeoBio-Center is highly interdisciplinary and consists of researchers from different departments including paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, zoology and botany.

- Further information can be found at <a href="http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/hoehna">http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/hoehna</a>, and questions should be directed to Sebastian Höhna (phylomatics@gmail.com). Applications, including a current CV, letter of motivation (1 page) and names and contact details of two referees should be sent to Sebastian Höhna before the deadline of 31 October 2018.
