{% subsection Exercise 2 %}
-   Run an MCMC simulation to estimate the posterior distribution of the
    speciation rate and extinction rate.
-   Visualize the branch-specific rates in `FigTree`.
-   Do you see evidence for rate decreases or increases? What is the
    general trend?
-   Run the analysis using a different number of categories,
    *e.g.*, 2 or 6. How do the rates change?
-   Modify the model by specifying a prior on the log-diversification
    and log-turnover rate and then estimate the diversification rates
    through time. Do you see any differences in the estimates?
