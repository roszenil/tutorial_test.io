{% subsection Exercise 1 %}
-  Run an MCMC simulation to estimate the posterior distribution of the speciation rate and extinction rate.
- Visualize the branch-specific rates in `R` using `RevGadgets`.
- Do you see evidence for rate decreases or increases? What is the general trend?
- Run the analysis using a different number of rate categories (`NUM_RATE_CATEGORIES`), *e.g.,* 4 or 10. How do the rates change?
