{% section Introduction | introduction %}

In the previous examples we have modeled all character state transitions
as anagenetic changes.
Anagenetic changes occur along the branches of a phylogeny, within a lineage.
Cladogenetic changes, on the other hand, occur at speciation events.
They represent changes in a character state that may be associated with speciation events
due to increased reproductive isolation,
for example colonizing a new geographic area or a shift in chromosome number.
Note that it can be quite tricky to determine if a character state shift is a cause or a consequence of speciation, but we can at least test if state changes tend to occur in the same time window as speciation events.

A major challenge for all phylogenetic models of cladogenetic character change
is accounting for unobserved speciation events due to lineages going extinct
and not leaving any extant descendants {% cite Bokma2002 %},
or due to incomplete sampling of lineages in the present.
Teasing apart
the phylogenetic signal for cladogenetic and anagenetic processes given
unobserved speciation events is a major difficulty.
Commonly used biographic models like the
dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC; {% citet Ree2008 %}) simply ignore
unobserved speciation events and so result in biased
estimates of cladogenetic versus anagenetic change.

This bias can be avoided by using the
Cladogenetic State change Speciation and Extinction
(ClaSSE) model {% cite Goldberg2012 %},
which accounts for unobserved speciation events
by jointly modeling both character evolution
and the phylogenetic birth-death process.
ClaSSE models extend other SSE models by incorporating both cladogenetic
and anagenetic character evolution.
This approach has been used to model biogeographic range evolution {% cite Goldberg2011 %}
and chromosome number evolution {% cite Freyman2017 %}.

Here we will use RevBayes to examine biogeographic range evolution in the primates.
We will model biogeographic range evolution similar to a DEC model,
however we will use ClaSSE to account for speciation events unobserved due
to extinction or incomplete sampling.

## Setting up the analysis

### Reading in the data

Begin by reading in the observed tree.
```
observed_phylogeny <- readTrees("data/primates_biogeo.tre")[1]
```
Get the taxa in the tree. We'll need this later on.
```
taxa = observed_phylogeny.taxa()
```

Now let's read in the biogeographic range data. The areas are represented as the following character states:

- 0 = 00 = the null state with no range
- 1 = 01 = New World only
- 2 = 10 = Old World only
- 3 = 11 = both New and Old World

For consistency, we have chosen to use the same representation of biogeographic ranges used in the \RevBayes biogeography/DEC tutorial.
Each range is represented as both a natural number (0, 1, 2, 3) and a corresponding bitset (00, 01, 10, 11).
The null state (state 0) is used in DEC models to represent a lineage that has no biogeographic range and is therefore extinct.
Our model will include this null state as well, however, we will explicitly model extinction as part of the birth-death
process so our character will never enter state 0.
```
data_biogeo = readCharacterDataDelimited("data/primates_biogeo.tsv", stateLabels="0123", type="NaturalNumbers", delimiter="\t", headers=TRUE)
```

Also we need to create the move and monitor vectors.
```
moves = VectorMoves()
monitors = VectorMonitors()
```

### Set up the extinction rates

We are going to draw both anagenetic transition rates
and diversification rates from a lognormal distribution.
The mean of the prior distribution will be
$\ln(\frac{\text{\#Taxa}}{2}) / \text{tree-age}$
which is the expected net
diversification rate, and the SD will be 1.0 so the 95\%
prior interval ranges well over 2 orders of magnitude.
```
num_species <- 424 # approximate total number of primate species
rate_mean <- ln( ln(num_species/2.0) / observed_phylogeny.rootAge() )
rate_sd <- 1.0
```

The extinction rates will be stored in a vector where each element represents
the extinction rate for the corresponding character state.
We have chosen to allow a lineage to go extinct in both the New and Old World
at the same time (like a global extinction event). As an alternative, you could
restrict the model so that a lineage can only go extinct if it's range is limited
to one area.
```
extinction_rates[1] <- 0.0 # the null state (state 0)
extinction_rates[2] ~ dnLognormal(rate_mean, rate_sd) # extinction when the lineage is in New World (state 1)
extinction_rates[3] ~ dnLognormal(rate_mean, rate_sd) # extinction when the lineage is in Old World (state 2)
extinction_rates[4] ~ dnLognormal(rate_mean, rate_sd) # extinction when in both (state 3)
```
Note \Rev vectors are indexed starting with 1, yet our character states start
at 0. So \texttt{extinction\_rate[1]} will represent the extinction rate for character
state 0.

Add MCMC moves for each extinction rate.
```
moves.append( mvSlide( extinction_rates[2], weight=4 ) )
moves.append( mvSlide( extinction_rates[3], weight=4 ) )
moves.append( mvSlide( extinction_rates[4], weight=4 ) )
```

Let's also create a deterministic variable to monitor the overall extinction rate.
```
total_extinction := sum(extinction_rates)
```

### Set up the anagenetic transition rate matrix

First, let's create the rates of anagenetic dispersal:
```
anagenetic_dispersal_13 ~ dnLognormal(rate_mean, rate_sd) # disperse from New to Old World 01 -> 11
anagenetic_dispersal_23 ~ dnLognormal(rate_mean, rate_sd) # disperse from Old to New World 10 -> 11
```

Now add MCMC moves for each anagenetic dispersal rate.
```
moves.append( mvSlide( anagenetic_dispersal_13, weight=4 ) )
moves.append( mvSlide( anagenetic_dispersal_23, weight=4 ) )
```

The anagenetic transitions will be stored in a 4 by 4
instantaneous rate matrix. We will construct this by
first creating a vector of vectors. Let's begin by
initalizing all rates to 0.0:
```
for (i in 1:4) {
    for (j in 1:4) {
        r[i][j] <- 0.0
    }
}
```

Now we can populate non-zero rates into the anagenetic transition rate matrix:
```
r[2][4] := anagenetic_dispersal_13
r[3][4] := anagenetic_dispersal_23
r[4][2] := extinction_rates[3]
r[4][3] := extinction_rates[2]
```
Note that we have modeled the rate of 11 $\rightarrow$ 01 (3 $\rightarrow$ 1) as being
the rate of going extinct in area 2, and the rate of 11 $\rightarrow$ 10 (3 $\rightarrow$ 2)
as being the rate of going extinct in area 1.

Now we pass our vector of vectors into the \cl{fnFreeK} function to create
the instaneous rate matrix.
```
ana_rate_matrix := fnFreeK(r, rescaled=false)
```

### Set up the cladogenetic speciation rate matrix

Here we need to define each cladogenetic event type in the form
`[ancestor\_state, daughter1\_state, daughter2\_state]`
and assign each cladogenetic event type a corresponding
speciation rate.

The first type of cladogenetic event we'll specify is widespread sympatry.
Widespread sympatric cladogenesis is where the biogeographic range does
not change; that is the daughter lineages inherit the same range as
the ancestor. In this example we are not going to allow the speciation events like
11 $\rightarrow$ 11, 11, as it seems biologically implausible. However if you wanted
you could add this to your model.

Define the speciation rate for widespread sympatric cladogenesis events:
```
speciation_wide_sympatry ~ dnLognormal(rate_mean, rate_sd)
moves.append( mvSlide( speciation_wide_sympatry, weight=4 ) )
```

Define the widespread sympatric cladogenetic events:
```
clado_events[1] = [1, 1, 1] # 01 -> 01, 01
clado_events[2] = [2, 2, 2] # 10 -> 10, 10
```

and assign each the same speciation rate:
```
speciation_rates[1] := speciation_wide_sympatry/2
speciation_rates[2] := speciation_wide_sympatry/2
```

Subset sympatry is where one daughter lineage inherits the full
ancestral range but the other lineage inherits only a single region.
```
speciation_sub_sympatry ~ dnLognormal(rate_mean, rate_sd)
moves.append( mvSlide( speciation_sub_sympatry, weight=4 ) )
```

Define the subset sympatry events and assign each a speciation rate:
```
clado_events[3] = [3, 3, 1] # 11 -> 11, 01
clado_events[4] = [3, 1, 3] # 11 -> 01, 11
clado_events[5] = [3, 3, 2] # 11 -> 11, 10
clado_events[6] = [3, 2, 3] # 11 -> 10, 11
speciation_rates[3] := speciation_sub_sympatry/4
speciation_rates[4] := speciation_sub_sympatry/4
speciation_rates[5] := speciation_sub_sympatry/4
speciation_rates[6] := speciation_sub_sympatry/4
```

Allopatric cladogenesis is when the two daughter lineages
split the ancestral range:
```
speciation_allopatry ~ dnLognormal(rate_mean, rate_sd)
moves.append( mvSlide( speciation_allopatry, weight=4 ) )
```

Define the allopatric events:
```
clado_events[7] = [3, 1, 2] # 11 -> 01, 10
clado_events[8] = [3, 2, 1] # 11 -> 10, 01
speciation_rates[7] := speciation_allopatry/2
speciation_rates[8] := speciation_allopatry/2
```

Now let's create a deterministic variable to monitor the overall speciation rate:
```
total_speciation := sum(speciation_rates)
```

Finally, we construct the cladogenetic speciation rate
matrix from the cladogenetic event types and the speciation rates.
```
clado_matrix := fnCladogeneticSpeciationRateMatrix(clado_events, speciation_rates, 4)
```

Let's view the cladogenetic matrix to see if we have set it up correctly:
```
clado_matrix
```

### Set up the cladogenetic character state-dependent birth-death process

For simplicity we will fix the root frequencies to be equal except for the null state
which has probability of 0.
```
root_frequencies <- simplex([0, 1, 1, 1])
```

`rho` is the probability of sampling species at the present:
```
rho <- observed_phylogeny.ntips()/num_species
```

Now we construct a stochastic variable drawn from the cladogenetic
character state-dependent birth-death process.
```
classe ~ dnCDCladoBDP( rootAge         = observed_phylogeny.rootAge(),
                       cladoEventMap   = clado_matrix,
                       extinctionRates = extinction_rates,
                       Q               = ana_rate_matrix,
                       delta           = 1.0,
                       pi              = root_frequencies,
                       rho             = rho,
                       condition       = "time",
                       taxa            = taxa )
```

Clamp the model with the observed data.
```
classe.clamp( observed_phylogeny )
classe.clampCharData( data_biogeo )
```

### Finalize the model

Just like before, we must create a workspace model object.
```
mymodel = model(classe)
```

\subsection{Set up and run the MCMC}

First, set up the monitors that will output parameter values to file and screen.
```
monitors.append( mnModel(filename="output/primates_ClaSSE.log", printgen=1) )
monitors.append( mnJointConditionalAncestralState(tree=observed_phylogeny, cdbdp=classe, type="NaturalNumbers", printgen=1, withTips=true, withStartStates=true, filename="output/anc_states_primates_ClaSSE.log") )
monitors.append( mnScreen(printgen=1, speciation_wide_sympatry, speciation_sub_sympatry, speciation_allopatry, extinction_rates) )
```

Now define our workspace MCMC object.
```
mymcmc = mcmc(mymodel, monitors, moves)
```

We will perform a pre-burnin to tune the proposals
and then run the MCMC. Note that for a real analysis you would
want to run the MCMC for many more iterations.
```
mymcmc.burnin(generations=200,tuningInterval=5)
mymcmc.run(generations=1000)
```

## Summarize ancestral states

When the analysis has completed you now summarize the ancestral states.
The ancestral states are estimated both for the "beginning" and "end"
state of each branch, so that the cladogenetic changes that occurred at speciation events
are distinguished from the changes that occurred anagenetically along branches.
Make sure the `include_start_states` argument is set to `true`.
```
anc_states = readAncestralStateTrace("output/anc_states_primates_ClaSSE.log")
anc_tree = ancestralStateTree(tree=observed_phylogeny, ancestral_state_trace_vector=anc_states, include_start_states=true, file="output/anc_states_primates_ClaSSE_results.tree", burnin=0, summary_statistic="MAP", site=0)
```

### Plotting ancestral states

Like before, we'll plot the ancestral states
using the `RevGadgets` `R` package.
Execute the script `plot_anc_states_ClaSSE.R` in `R`.
The results can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:results_ClaSSE}.
The maximum *a posteriori* (MAP) estimate for each node is shown as well as the posterior probability of the states represented by the size of the dots.

```{R}
library(RevGadgets)

tree_file = "output/anc_states_primates_ClaSSE_results.tree"

plot_ancestral_states(tree_file, summary_statistic="MAPRange",
                      tip_label_size=3,
                      tip_label_offset=1,
                      xlim_visible=c(0,100),
                      node_label_size=0,
                      shoulder_label_size=0,
                      include_start_states=TRUE,
                      show_posterior_legend=TRUE,
                      node_size_range=c(4, 7),
                      alpha=0.75)

output_file = "RevBayes_Anc_States_ClaSSE.pdf"
ggsave(output_file, width = 11, height = 9)
```

# Exercise

- Using either R or Tracer, visualize the posterior estimates for different types of cladogenetic events.
    What kind of speciation events are most common?
- As we have specified the model, we did not allow cladogenetic long
    distance (jump) dispersal, for example 01 $\rightarrow$ 01, 10.
    Modify this script to include cladogenetic
    long distance dispersal and calculate Bayes factors to see which model fits the data better.
    How does this affect the ancestral state estimate?
