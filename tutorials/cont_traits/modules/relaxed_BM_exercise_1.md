{% subsection Exercise 1 %}
- Run an MCMC simulation to estimate the posterior distribution of the branch-specific rates (`branch_rates`) assuming a prior expected number of rates shifts of 5.
- Plot the rates among branches under this prior.
- Change the prior expected number of rate shifts to 1, and then plot the branch-specific rates on the tree.
- Compare the posterior distributions for the total number of rate shifts under both priors using `Tracer`. Does the posterior distribution for the  total number of rate shifts seem to be sensitive to the prior?
- Compare the posterior mean estimates for branch-specific rate estimates under each prior. Does the posterior mean estimate branch-rate estimates appear to be sensitive to this prior?
