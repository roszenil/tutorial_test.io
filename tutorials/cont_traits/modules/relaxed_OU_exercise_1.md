{% subsection Exercise 1 %}
- Run an MCMC simulation to estimate the posterior distribution of the branch-specific thetas (`branch_thetas`) assuming a prior expected number of shifts of 5.
- Plot the thetas among branches under this prior.
- Change the prior expected number of shifts to 1, and then plot the branch-specific thetas on the tree.
- Compare the posterior distributions for the total number of shifts under both priors. Does the posterior distribution for the total number of shifts seem to be sensitive to the prior?
- Compare the posterior mean estimates under each prior. Do the posterior mean estimates estimates appear to be sensitive to this prior?
