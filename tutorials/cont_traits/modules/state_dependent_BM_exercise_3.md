{% subsection Exercise 3 %}
- Estimate the posterior distribution of the state-dependent rate parameters assuming a relaxed background-rate model.
- Compare the posterior estimates from the relaxed background-rate model to the posterior estimates from the constant background-rate model (_i.e._, `mcmc_state_dependent_BM.Rev`). Are our estimates of the state-dependent parameter inflated by excluding sources of rate variation other than the discrete character?
- Repeat the analysis with background-rate variation, but increase the expected number of rate shifts. Does this impact our estimates of the focal parameter, $\boldsymbol{\zeta^2}$?
