{% subsection Exercise 2 %}
- Modify the `mcmc_state_dependent_BM` script to use reversible-jump MCMC for the state-dependent model.
- Compute the posterior probability of the state-dependent model assuming a prior on the state-independent model of `p = 0.5`.
- Repeat the analysis, but this time specify a prior corresponding to a $75\%$ prior belief in the state-independent model.
- For each of the above priors, compute the corresponding posterior probabilities and Bayes factors for the state-dependent model. Are these estimates prior sensitive?
