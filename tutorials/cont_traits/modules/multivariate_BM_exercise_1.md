{% subsection Exercise 1 %}
- Run an MCMC simulation to estimate the posterior distribution of the correlation parameters (`correlations`).
- Run an MCMC under the prior to compute the prior distribution for the correlation parameters. Are the posterior correlations different from their prior?
- Change the prior on the concentration parameter, `eta`, to decrease the prior weight on high correlation parameters.
- Compare the posterior distribution of `correlations` under these two values of `eta`. Are posterior estimates sensitive to the prior concentration parameter?
