{% section Reversible-jump MCMC to test for irreversibility | sec_ase_ir_rj %}

In the previous section we assumed that there are 2 different rates, which are all $>0$.
Now, we will apply a reversible-jump MCMC {% cite Green1995 %} to test if any of the rates is significantly larger than $0$.


>Make a copy of the Rev script file you just made.
>Call them `mcmc_ase_freeK_RJ.Rev.
>This will contain the new model parameters and models.

{% subsection Modifying the MCMC Section %}

At each place in which the output files are specified in the MCMC section, change the output path so you don't overwrite the output from the previous exercise.
For example, you might call your output file `output/solitariness_ase_irrev.log`.

{% subsection Modifying the Model Section %}

The only part in the model section that we are going to modify is the prior distributions and moves on the rate parameters.
We will assume the same rate for the exponential prior distribution as before.
```
rate_pr := phylogeny.treeLength() / 10
```
Next, we specify that we have a 0.5 probability, *a priori*, that a rate is equal to 0.
```
mix_pr <- 0.5
```
We will specify again our rates within a `for`-loop, which makes changing this script to other number of character states very easy.
We will explain each element within in the `for`-loop below.
```
for ( i in 1:NUM_RATES ) {
    rate[i] ~ dnRJMixture(0.0, dnExp(rate_pr), p=mix_pr)
    prob_rate[i] := ifelse( rate[i] == 0, 1.0, 0.0 )
    moves.append( mvScale( rate[i], weight=2 ) )
    moves.append( mvRJSwitch( rate[i], weight=2 ) )
}
```
First, we can create our reversible-jump distributions `dnRJMixture`, which take in a constant value, 0.0 in this case, and a distribution `dnExp(rate_pr)`.
Thus, the value is either drawn to be exactly equal to the constant value (0.0 here), or drawn from the base distribution (the exponential distribution in this case).
The last argument specifies the probability of the constant value `p=mix_pr`, which is important later for model comparison.

Second, since we are interested in the probability that a rate is equal to 0.0, we want to compute this posterior probability directly.
Therefore, we will use the `ifelse` function, which will return 1.0 if the rate is equal to 0.0, and 0.0 otherwise (if the rate is unequal to 0.0).
Hence, the frequency with which we sample a 1.0 gives us the posterior probability that a given rate is equal to 0.0.

Third, we also need to specify specific moves that *jump* in parameter dimension.
We will use the `mvRJSwitch` move that changes the value to be either equal to the constant value
provided from the `dnRJMixture` or a value drawn from the base distribution (the exponential distribution).

Additionally, we also need to specify moves that change the rates if they are not equal to 0.0.
As usual, we use the standard scaling moves.

{% subsection Visualizing Ancestral State Estimates | subsec_ase_plots %}

We have previously seen in {% page_ref morph_ase/ase %} and {% page_ref morph_ase/ase_free %} how the ancestral states of the simple model equal rates Markov(ERM) model and the independent rates model look.
You should repeat plotting the ancestral states now also for the irreversible (`irrev`) analyses.
My output is shown in {% ref fig_anc_states_irrev %}


{% figure fig_anc_states_irrev %}
<img src="figures/Primates_solitariness_ASE_irrev_MAP.png" width="400" />
<img src="figures/Primates_solitariness_ASE_irrev_Pie.png" width="400" />
{% figcaption %}
Ancestral state estimates of solitariness under the irreversible model. You might see that some ancestral states have changed.
{% endfigcaption %}
{% endfigure %}

Next, we also want to see if there was support for the irreversible model.
Therefore, we will plot the probability that a rate was equal to 0.0.
You can do this nicely in `RevGadgets` {% cite Tribble2022 %}
```{R}
library(RevGadgets)
library(ggplot2)

CHARACTER  <- "solitariness"

# specify the input file
file <- paste0("output/",CHARACTER,"_irrev.log")

# read the trace and discard burnin
trace_qual <- readTrace(path = file, burnin = 0.25)

# produce the plot object, showing the posterior distributions of the rates.
p <- plotTrace(trace = trace_qual,
          vars = paste0("prob_rate[",1:NUM_RATES,"]"))[[1]] +
     # modify legend location using ggplot2
     theme(legend.position = c(0.85,0.85))

ggsave(paste0("Primates_",CHARACTER,"_irrev.pdf"), p, width = 5, height = 5)
```

{% figure fig_prob_irrev %}
<img src="figures/Primates_solitariness_irrev.png" width="400" />
{% figcaption %}
Probability that a rate was equal to 0.0. We see ambiguous support that the rate of gain was equal to 0.0. Conversely, we don't see any strong support that the rate of gain was not 0.0! We clearly see decisive support that the rate of loss was not equal to 0.0.
