title: Introduction to Phylogenomics 
location: Anywhere (online-only event)
startdate: 2020-10-1
enddate: 2020-10-9

instructors: 
- <a href="https://phyleauxlab.github.io/">Jeremy M. Brown</a>
- <a href="http://thomsonlab.org/">Bob Thomson</a>

description: 
- This workshop will introduce participants to the theory and tools for phylogenetic inference in the era of genome sequencing. Course material will focus on statistical methods for phylogeny estimation, software implementing these methods, applications of these methods to large molecular datasets, and discuss trade-offs and tools for improving the accuracy of phylogenomic analyses. In hands-on practical sessions, participants will gain experience working with bioinformatic and statistical tools for analyzing large datasets.

- The course is intended to facilitate ongoing or planned phylogenomics projects by students, so they are encouraged to notify instructors in advance about the topics of greatest relevance to their own work.

schedule:
- The live classes will run on week days, including Thursday (Oct. 1st) to Friday (Oct. 2nd) and Monday (Oct. 5th) to Friday (Oct. 9th).

- Live sessions will be held from 18:00 to 21:00 (GMT+1).

- The rest of the course will be taught with recorded classes and assignments, to be done between the live sessions.

software:
- Participants will need access to a computer (Unix, Mac OSX, Windows) to complete the tutorials, as well as a web-enabled device (computer or mobile device) capable of running communication tools.
