description: 
- <p>Instruction in Bayesian phylogenetic inference and divergence-time estimation will be taught at <a href="https://molevol.mbl.edu/index.php/Main_Page">the Workshop on Molecular Evolution</a> at the <a href="http://www.mbl.edu/">Marine Biological Laboratory</a> (MBL). This course was founded in 1988 and is the longest-running workshop serving the field of evolutionary biology. Students work closely with internationally-recognized scientists, receiving (i) high-level instruction in the principles of molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics, (ii) advanced training in statistical methods best suited to modern datasets, and (iii) hands-on experience with the latest software tools (often from the authors of the programs they are using). The material is delivered via lectures, discussions, and bioinformatic exercises motivated by contemporary topics in molecular evolution. A hallmark of this workshop is the direct interaction between students and field-leading scientists. The workshop serves graduate students, postdocs, and established faculty from around the world seeking to apply the principles of molecular evolution to questions of anthropology, conservation genetics, development, behavior, physiology, and ecology. The workshop also welcomes participants from federal agencies and science journalists. A priority of this workshop is to foster an environment where students can learn from each other as well from the course faculty.</p><p>For the full workshop content, list of faculty, and schedule, please see the <a href="https://molevolworkshop.github.io">main course website</a>.</p>
