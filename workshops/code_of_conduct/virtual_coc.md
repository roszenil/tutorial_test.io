# Policy on harassment and discrimination

Harassment of others by any participant (attendee or instructor) will not be tolerated. Unacceptable treatment of others includes (but is not limited to) unwanted verbal attention, intimidation, stalking, shaming, or bullying. Inappropriate behavior via any medium (e.g., direct message, chats, email, video conferencing) is a violation of this code of conduct.  Discrimination or exclusion on the basis of gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or similar will not be tolerated. Critiques of scientific work are appropriate and important, but all forms of communication must be free of offensive, discriminatory or disrespectful elements, including (but not limited to) words and images that are derogatory or demeaning to individuals or groups [1]. Inappropriate comments presented in a joking manner constitute unacceptable behavior. Retaliation for reporting inappropriate behavior is also unacceptable, as is reporting an incident in bad faith.

Workshop participants or instructors wishing to report a violation of this code of conduct by any member of this group can contact any of the instructors via direct message on Slack or email. Incidents of inappropriate and uncivil behavior are taken extremely seriously. Confidentiality will be maintained unless disclosure is legally required.

Workshop instructors will act as moderators in the Slack space and during interactive sessions. Instructors reserve the right to enforce this code of conduct in any manner deemed appropriate. Anyone violating the code of conduct may be: (a) asked to stop, (b) subjected to limits on or revocation of any means of active participation in the workshop (i.e., muted microphone, blocked video access, removed Slack access), (c) expelled from the workshop. Establishing and enforcing this code of conduct is intended to prevent incidents of harassment, discrimination, and incivility, and to maintain a high quality of scientific discourse.

[1] Disagreements about science are normal and healthy parts of academic discourse. Civil and constructive criticism of someone’s work for a perceived methodological flaw or a misinterpretation of results is appropriate. Demeaning a scientist for being sloppy, misleading or stupid and other ad hominem attacks are inappropriate. ​[[https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2000/07/joy-criticism](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2000/07/joy-criticism)] 
 
# Policy on liability

Instructors shall not be responsible for any defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of all participants, and shall not be held liable for or damage of any kind suffered by the participants at or in connection with the event.

# Procedures
