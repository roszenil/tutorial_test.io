For our tutorials we recommend that you download and install the latest release
of RevBayes {% cite Hoehna2016b %}, which is available for Mac OS X, Windows,
and Linux operating systems. Directions for downloading and installing
the software are available on the program webpage:
<a href="http://revbayes.com">http://revbayes.com</a>. The exercises provided often also
require additional programs for editing text files and visualizing
output. The following are very useful tools for working with RevBayes:

- A good text editor – if you do not already have one that you like,
    we recommend one that has features for syntax coloring, easy
    navigation between different files, line numbers, etc. Good options
    include <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, 
    <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">NotePad++</a>, which are available for Mac OSX, Windows,
    and Linux.

- <a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/">Tracer</a> – for
    visualizing and assessing numerical parameter samples from
    RevBayes

- <a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/">FigTree</a> – a tree visualization program

- Some of the output can be automatically visualized using pre-made 
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> functions provided by 
    our R-package <a href="https://github.com/revbayes/RevGadgets">RevGadgets</a>. 
    You should make sure that you have a recent release of 
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> and 
    <a href="https://github.com/revbayes/RevGadgets">RevGadgets</a> installed.

- <a href="http://tgvaughan.github.io/icytree/">IcyTree</a> – a web-hosted
    phylogenetic tree visualization tool that is supported for
